<b>England became the ninth team to book a place at next year's European Championship after beating Italy 3-1 at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday, two years

on from losing the final to the Italians at

the same venue.

Scamacca - his first for his country - but

England turned the game around with two

goals from captain Harry Kane and one

from Marcus Rashford.

England joins host nation Germany and previously qualified Austria, Belgium, France, Portugal, Scotland, Spain and Turkey at next year's 24-team tournament.

Defeat to England deepened the gloom around the Italian team amid a scandal around players' alleged involvement in an illegal betting ring. Premier League midfielders Sandro Tonali and Nicolò Zaniolo left the Italy camp last week after being questioned by police.

Italy's game with Ukraine on November 20 will decide which team gets the second qualifying spot in Group C along with England.

Italy's game with Ukraine on November 20 will decide which team gets the second qualifying spot in Group C along with England. Italy is seeking to avoid missing a second tournament in a row after failing to qualify for the World Cup last year. The decider is officially a home game for Ukraine but will take place in Germany because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The Ukrainians had to recover from a goal

down to beat Malta 3-1. The win was

sealed when Chelsea winger Mykhailo

Mudryk scored a powerful long-range shot

for his first international goal.</b></font>
